This is a list of things that need to be done in the Web Client
so that the new API for fleet-action can be supported.

TO DO:
shipyard:
  Although all the API changes to shipyard have been done (see t/470_fleet_shipyard.t)
  and (I think) the Lacuna-Web-Client has been changed, I can't get it to work as I
  remember it used to work. I don't know what has changed.
  
  As far as I can tell, everything's working in the shipyard. -fireartist

spaceport:
  The spaceport is in an indeterminate state, I can't get it to work but some of the
  API has been done (see t/460_fleet_spaceport.t) for working code.
  
  'travelling' view - working
  'view'            - working
  'send'            - working

API CALLS:
	SpacePort:
		view_travelling_fleets()  - Seems to work fine - not tested fully.
		view_all_fleets()         - Seems to work fine - not tested fully.
		view_available_fleets()   - Works fully, UI completed.
		view_unavailable_fleets() - Works fully, UI completed.
		send_fleet()              - Works fully, UI completed.
		recall_fleet()            - Untested.
		rename_fleet()            - Is working - tested.
		scuttle_fleet()           - Is working - tested.
		view_orbiting_fleets()    - making the request now succeeds. More work to be done.
		view_incoming_fleets()    - Works fully, UI almost completed; need to test what a large Payload looks like.
	
Other Issues:
	1.  SOLVED: Something in rpc.js is making the parameters empty. Need to do a very close analysis for find the bug.
	    This causes the server to return error 1006 (Session Expired) but not give any information about why.
    
    2.  Mining Platform Ships - on arrival, a fleet of multiple ships is treated as a single ship.
    
    3.  Fighters sent to orbit / defend a body are not merged into a single fleet with any other fleets
        with identical stats already orbiting / defending the body. - Is this by design?
