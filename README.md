# Hacking

Lacuna-Web-Client requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) to hack on. For
installing, see [their downloads page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). If you've installed Node.js in the past, please ensure you have Node.js version `4.x.x` or `5.x.x` and npm version `3.x.x`.

Once you've got that, setting up and running everything should look something like this:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Lacuna-Web-Client
cd Lacuna-Web-Client

# These should be one-offs. These commands install gulp and bower into the
# global namespace so they can be used on the command line.
#
# Gulp is a task runner; it handles building and running the code.
# Bower is a package manager; it handles downloading JS modules that can't
# be downloaded off of npm the way everything else should.
npm install gulp -g
npm install bower -g

# Installs the dependencies for building and running the code.
# This should be done every time the `package.son` file changes.
npm install

# Compiles js/css and launches dev server.
gulp dev
```

# Development

The following are some notes and conventions about the changes that are happening here. The client is slowly being transitioned over to some new libraries and a new structure. They are as follows:

- [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)
    - This is the CSS framework that makes everything look pretty.
    - Semantic UI also has a JavaScript component that is jQuery-based.
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
    - React is described as the V in MVC. It's only responsible for managing what the page looks like.
- [Reflux](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs#refluxjs)
    - Reflux is an implementation of Facebook's Flux structure which is used in conjunction with React.
- [Lodash](https://lodash.com/docs)
    - Lodash is just a general purpose utility library.
- [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/)
    - Gulp is the build tool. Think of it like `make` or `ant`.
- [Browserify](https://browserify.org/)
    - Browserify is the tool that gets all the dependencies and all the files in the project and smashes it all together into one file.

## Conventions

### Actions

See [Actions](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs#creating-actions).

There are several ways to define a set of actions. In this project, the following is used:

```javascript
var Reflux = require('reflux');

var StatusActions = Reflux.createActions([
    'foo',
    'bar',
    'baz'
]);
```

### Stores

See [Stores](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs#creating-data-stores).

There are several ways to define a stores and listen to actions. In this project, the following is used:

```javascript
var Reflux = require('reflux');

var StatusStore = Reflux.createStore({
    listenables: SomeActions, // See above

    getInitialState: function() {
        return '';
    },

    onFoo: function() {
        this.trigger('Foo was clicked.');
    },

    onBar: function() {
        this.trigger('Bar was clicked.');
    },

    onBaz: function() {
        this.trigger('Baz was clicked');
    }
});
```

### Components

See [React Components](https://github.com/spoike/refluxjs#react-component-example).

There are several ways to define React Components. In this project, the following is used:

```javascript
var React = require('react');
var Reflux = require('reflux');

var Demo = React.createClass({
    mixins: [
        Reflux.connect(StatusStore, 'status')
    ]
    render: function() {
        return (
            <div>
                <button type="button" onClick={StatusActions.foo}>Foo</button>
                <button type="button" onClick={StatusActions.bar}>Bar</button>
                <button type="button" onClick={StatusActions.baz}>Baz</button>
                <br />
                <p>
                    {this.state.status}
                </p>
            </div>
        );
    }
})
```

### Windows

Every single window in the game (Stats or Mail, for example) need several things. We'll use the "About" window as an example.

### Actions

AboutActions: `app/js/actions/window/about.js`

All interactions (show, hide, load) are called from here. This is pretty simple.

### Stores

Each window should have both of these stores (or more, depending on the data the window needs from the server).

AboutWindowStore: `app/js/stores/window/about.js`

This store is simply for storing a Boolean value which indicates weather the window should be shown or not.

CreditsRPCStore: `app/js/stores/rpc/stats/credits.js`

This store is responsible for storing the data that comes from the server. It's then used by the component to show interesting things to the user.

### Components

AboutWindow: `app/js/components/window/about.jsx`

There's nothing fancy here. It's just a React component that uses some data.

### Server Calls

I've implemented a new module for sending requests to the game. It's usage and documentation is below.

```javascript
var Reflux = require('reflux');

var server = require('js/server');

var SomeStore = Reflux.createStore({

    // NOTE: store setup not shown for simplicity.

    onSomeAction: function() {

        server.call({

            // Self-explanitory
            module: 'stats',

            // Self-explanitory
            method: 'credits',

            // Self-explanitory
            params: [],

            // This option determines weather the session id should be auto-magically added into the
            // params. It's default is `true` so it should almost never be needed.
            addSession: false,

            // This function gets called when a request succeeds and is passed the resulting data.
            // In the case of a store, unless you want to modify the data, simply give it
            // `this.trigger` and send the data on its merry way to the component.
            success: this.trigger,

            // Errors are shown to the user every time they occur. Therefore, this callback is only
            // required for component-specific error handling or whatever.
            error: function() {
                // Perform magic tricks here.
            }
        });
    }
});
```


## Extra Notes

- Do **not** `require('jquery')`! Instead `require('js/shims/jquery')`. `js/shims/jquery` is used to attach the jQuery plugins we use to the one jQuery object.

# Gulp Tasks

In this project, Gulp is used to manage building the code. All the tasks that can be run are documented below. **Note:** *there are several undocumented tasks. This is intentional as they are small parts of a larger task.*

## build

> `gulp build`

Runs the entire process of pulling all the JavaScript/CSS together and creates minified versions of them. This is the default task, meaning that running just `gulp` in the command line will run this task.

## dev

> `gulp dev`

This puts all the JavaScript and CSS together and starts a web server to run the web client. Open up a browser to the [US1 mirror page](http://us1.lacunaexpanse.com/local.html) and you should see the it working. It also watches for changes to the code and restarts when it sees anything changed.

## serve

> `gulp serve`

This just runs the server for running the client in a browser.

## clear

> `gulp clear`

This deletes temporary files and files from the build.
